# Design System: DuneBox

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Quiet Console"**

DuneBox's operator surfaces are a console, not a show. The sand under the projector is the spectacle; every screen an adult touches is calm, near-black, and legible at arm's length in a dim room, so it never competes with the projection. The direction is the category standard played straight (chosen by Max, 2026-10-03): a crisp dark product UI held to the craft level of Vercel and Linear. No themed or novelty world; no sand textures, no topo-line decoration in the chrome.

Density is moderate and job-grouped. The live sand view leads on the left with four honest facts beneath it; the right column holds controls grouped by job (World, Events, Games, Setup, DuneBox C++), each a hairline-bordered panel of 52px rows. Depth comes from stepped neutral layers, not shadows; color carries meaning only. A single blue says "on" or "selected"; green, amber and red say healthy, attention, broken, always paired with words.

The same tokens drive three surfaces: the web dashboard (the normative source, `web/assets/app.css`), the pygame settings sidebar, and the C++ ofxDatGui panel. When one of the native surfaces can't express a rule, it degrades toward the nearest honest equivalent described under Components, never toward a different look.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Near-black neutral layers (five steps from page to raised control) with 1px hairline borders.
- One blue accent, reserved for on/selected state and focus.
- Geist for all UI text; Geist Mono only for measurements, PINs, URLs and key caps.
- 44px minimum touch targets; 52px control rows.
- Flat at rest; shadows only on floating layers (popovers, toasts) and the selected segment.
- Motion is short and functional (150 to 220ms, one ease-out curve), and drops away under reduced motion.

## Colors

A neutral, almost achromatic dark ramp with one cool blue accent and three status hues that only ever mean system state.

### Primary
- **Signal Blue** (`accent`): the only "on" color. Fills an enabled switch track, outlines and tints the live-game card (`accent-border`, `accent-bg`), and draws the 2px focus ring. Never used for decoration, headings or links-as-ornament.

### Neutral
- **Projector Black** (`bg`): page background, and the recessed wells inside controls (PIN input, segmented track, copy field, QR plate). Recessed elements go *darker* than their container.
- **Panel** (`surface`): control groups, the live-view frame, the facts strip, the PIN gate.
- **Raised** (`surface-2`): secondary buttons, popovers, toasts; anything that floats or presses up.
- **Pressed / Selected** (`surface-3`): hover on secondary and ghost buttons, the selected segment, the off-state switch track.
- **Hairline** (`border`): every container edge and row divider.
- **Strong Hairline** (`border-strong`): edges of interactive raised elements (secondary buttons, inputs, switches, popovers, toasts, key caps).
- **Ink** (`text`): primary text and the primary-button fill.
- **Muted Ink** (`text-2`): labels, meta lines, hints, values, ghost buttons.
- **Faint Ink** (`text-3`): disabled text and idle status dots only. It still clears 4.5:1 on `surface`; do not go dimmer.

### Status
- **Healthy Green** (`ok`): status dot and toast dot for healthy/connected/success.
- **Attention Amber** (`warn`, `warn-bg`): status pill text and dot when degraded; border at 35% alpha.
- **Fault Red** (`err`, `err-bg`): status pill, offline banner, error toast, field errors.

### Named Rules
**The One Signal Rule.** Signal Blue means "this is on, selected, or focused" and nothing else. If an element isn't stateful, it isn't blue.

**The Words-With-Color Rule.** Every status hue ships with text that says the same thing ("Sensor: waiting", "Can't reach the sandbox."). A dot alone is never the message.

**The Real Palette Exception.** The only multi-hue color on screen is the theme swatch strip in the World group, which is generated from the sandbox's actual terrain palette data. It is evidence, not decoration; never hand-pick hues for it.

## Typography

**Display Font:** none; the console has no display tier.
**Body Font:** Geist (with ui-sans-serif, system-ui, Segoe UI fallback)
**Label/Mono Font:** Geist Mono (with ui-monospace, Cascadia Mono, Consolas fallback)

**Character:** A neutral grotesk and its mono sibling: the pairing reads as engineered and quiet, with Mono marking anything that is a measured or typed value. Geist was chosen deliberately despite the detector's overused-font warning: it is the house face of the Vercel quality bar this direction targets, it is OFL-licensed, and it is vendored offline (`web/assets/fonts/`) because the sandbox often runs with no internet. Keep it.

### Hierarchy
- **Headline** (600, 20px, -0.015em): the PIN gate title; the one heading that stands alone on a screen.
- **Title Large** (600, 16px, -0.01em): the DuneBox wordmark in the top bar.
- **Title** (600, 14px, -0.005em): section heads: "Live sand", control group legends, popover titles. Same size as body; weight does the work.
- **Body** (400, 14px, 1.5): row labels, banners, popover copy, toasts. Base size of the system.
- **Control** (500, 14px, line-height 1): button text.
- **Body Small** (400, 13px): meta lines, hints, field labels, status pills, segmented options.
- **Label** (400, 12px): fact and stat captions (`dt`).
- **Numeric** (Mono 500, 16px, tabular): the four live facts.
- **Numeric Large** (Mono 500, 20px, tabular): game score and time, PIN entry and PIN display (PINs add 0.15 to 0.2em tracking).

The ramp is compact (12 / 13 / 14 / 16 / 20) because this is a console at arm's length, not a page; hierarchy comes from weight and ink level more than size.

### Named Rules
**The Measured-Value Rule.** Geist Mono with tabular figures for anything that is a number from the system, a PIN, a URL or a key; Geist for everything a human wrote. Never set prose in Mono.

**The Weight-Not-Size Rule.** Section titles are body-size at 600. Don't escalate headings in size to create hierarchy inside the control column.

## Layout

A two-column operator grid: the live view (fluid, `minmax(0, 1fr)`) and a control column (340 to 400px), 24px gap and padding, max width 1440px, centered. The live view is sticky under the top bar so the sand stays visible while the operator scrolls controls; to stay shorter than the viewport, the frame is sized from height (`--frame-h`, `100vh - 370px` on desktop) times the source aspect ratio (`--ar`, set from each frame's width and height), so it never letterboxes. Under it sit the facts strip and a short Activity list. The control column is split by app: a **sandcam** header over its groups, then a **DuneBox** header with that app's status pill over its group, so both apps read as equals. The top bar is sticky, 10px × 24px padding, with brand left and status pills plus one action pushed right.

Spacing rhythm is a 4px base used mostly in 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 steps: 8 between inline items, 12 inside facts and cards, 16 between control groups and as panel side padding, 24 for page gutters.

Responsive behavior:
- **≤1023px:** single column, 16px gutters; the live view stops being sticky, caps at 52vh, and the Activity list is hidden.
- **≤640px:** top bar wraps with status pills on their own line; facts become a 2×2 grid; banner stacks; key-cap hints and the shortcut line disappear.
- **Touch (`hover: none`):** all key-cap hints are removed, since there's no keyboard to hint at.

### Named Rules
**The Arm's-Length Rule.** Interactive hit areas are never below 44px (`spacing.target`), and control rows are 52px. A switch's visible track is 36×20 inside a 52×44 hit area.

## Elevation & Depth

Flat by default, tonal layering for structure. Containers sit on the page by stepping one neutral lighter (`bg` to `surface` to `surface-2`) and drawing a 1px hairline; recessed wells step darker back to `bg`. Shadows exist only on things that genuinely float above the page, and they are neutral black, never colored.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Float** (`box-shadow: 0 16px 40px -8px rgba(0,0,0,0.7), 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`): popovers (pairing, keyboard shortcuts).
- **Toast** (`box-shadow: 0 12px 32px -8px rgba(0,0,0,0.7)`): notification toasts.
- **Seat** (`box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`): the selected option in a segmented control, so it reads as a raised key.

### Named Rules
**The No-Glow Rule.** No colored shadows, no blur halos, no backdrop-filter glass. Depth is tone plus hairline; a shadow is always black and only under something that floats.

## Shapes

Gently rounded rectangles throughout. Containers (groups, frames, popovers, toasts, banner) use 8px (`rounded.md`); controls inside them use 6px (`rounded.sm`); the smallest nested pieces (segmented options, key caps) use 4px (`rounded.xs`). Pills (status chips, switch tracks) and dots are fully round. Every edge is a 1px hairline; key caps alone get a 2px bottom edge to read as physical keys. The brand mark is two stroked dune curves, 1.8px stroke, round caps, second line at 50% opacity.

### Named Rules
**The Nesting Rule.** Radius steps down as you go inward: 8 for the container, 6 for the control, 4 for the part inside the control.

## Components

### Buttons
Quiet and solid; the label carries the action.
- **Shape:** gently rounded (`rounded.sm`), 44px minimum height, 14px side padding, 8px gap for an inline key cap.
- **Primary:** Ink fill with Projector Black text; brightens to pure white on hover. Used for at most one decisive action in view ("Connect", "Start sandbox").
- **Secondary:** the workhorse. Raised fill with a Strong Hairline; hover steps to Pressed/Selected and a lighter border.
- **Ghost:** no fill, Muted Ink; hover adds the Pressed/Selected fill and full Ink. For inline, low-stakes actions (Copy, creature set, stepper ±).
- **Small / Icon:** small drops text to 13px and padding to 10px but keeps the 44px height; icon buttons are 44px square.
- **Disabled / Busy:** disabled goes transparent with Faint Ink and a Hairline; busy (`aria-busy`) dims text to Muted Ink. Neither changes the cursor to pointer.
- **Transitions:** background, border and color at 150ms on the house ease-out curve.

### Chips (status pills)
- **Style:** 32px tall fully round pill, Hairline border, Muted Ink text at 13px, leading 8px dot.
- **State:** idle dot is Faint Ink; ok dot is Healthy Green; warn and err tint text, dot and border (35% alpha) in the status hue. Text always states the condition.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** 8px (`rounded.md`).
- **Background:** Panel (`surface`).
- **Shadow Strategy:** none; see Elevation & Depth.
- **Border:** 1px Hairline.
- **Internal Padding:** control groups 4px top, 16px sides, 12px bottom with a title row; facts cells 12×16 with Hairline dividers between cells.
- **Disabled group:** contents (not the title or empty-state copy) drop to 50% opacity when the app behind it isn't linked.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** recessed well: Projector Black fill, Strong Hairline, 6px radius, 44px tall. The PIN field is Numeric Large with wide tracking.
- **Focus:** border shifts to Signal Blue and the 2px focus ring sits flush (offset 0).
- **Error:** Fault Red message below the field in 13px, with reserved height so the layout doesn't jump.

### Navigation
The top bar is the only navigation: sticky, near-opaque Projector Black (92%), Hairline bottom edge. Brand mark plus wordmark left; status pills and a single secondary action ("Open on a tablet") right. On narrow screens the pills wrap to a full-width second line.

### Switch (signature control)
Binary settings use a switch, never a checkbox. 36×20 track, 14px knob, inside a 52×44 hit area. Off: Pressed/Selected track, Strong Hairline, Muted Ink knob. On: Signal Blue track and border, Projector Black knob slid 16px. Knob slides at 200ms; under reduced motion it snaps.

### Segmented Theme Picker (signature control)
A recessed 4-up radio group: Projector Black track, 2px padding and gap, 6px outer radius. Options are 40px tall, label over a 4px real-palette swatch strip; selected option takes the Pressed/Selected fill, full Ink and the Seat shadow. Arrow keys move selection.

### Control Row
A 52px row: label left (with a key-cap hint revealed on hover or focus-within, hidden on touch), control right, Hairline divider below. Stacked rows hold full-width controls; hints sit beneath in 13px Muted Ink.

### App Header
Above each app's groups: the app name at 16px/600 with muted meta (language and what it does) in 13px Faint Ink, and, for DuneBox, a status pill pushed right. The same app state appears as a pill in the top bar. Each app keeps its own name; never one generic "Sandbox" label.

### Activity List
Desktop only, under the facts. The last eight command acknowledgements, newest first, each with a 6px status dot, the sandbox's own message in 13px Muted Ink (Ink when it failed), and the time right-aligned in Mono. It scrolls after three rows so the sticky view still fits. Every row is a real reply; nothing is logged speculatively.

### Live Game Card
Inside Games, an active game gets a Signal Blue tinted card (`accent-bg` fill, `accent-border` edge, 6px radius) with the game name in 600 and score/time in Numeric Large. This is the one place the accent fills an area: a game running is the loudest "on" state the console has.

### Popovers and Toasts
Raised fill, Strong Hairline, 8px radius, Float or Toast shadow. Popovers are 360px max, anchored top-right (pairing) or bottom-right (shortcuts). Toasts stack bottom-right, lead with a status dot, and slide up 8px over 220ms (none under reduced motion).

### Key Caps
Geist Mono 11px in Muted Ink on Raised fill, Strong Hairline with a 2px bottom edge, 4px radius. Used for shortcut hints only.

### Native surfaces: pygame sidebar and ofxDatGui panel
The web tokens are normative; the two native panels reuse the same values. Fonts: Geist and Geist Mono TTFs in `assets/fonts/` (pygame) and `DuneBox/bin/data/fonts/` (ofxDatGui). Use static weight instances (Regular 400, Medium 500, SemiBold 600) since neither renderer selects variable-font axes.

| Token | Hex / ofColor | pygame RGB |
|---|---|---|
| bg | `0x0a0a0a` | `(10, 10, 10)` |
| surface | `0x111111` | `(17, 17, 17)` |
| surface-2 | `0x171717` | `(23, 23, 23)` |
| surface-3 | `0x1f1f1f` | `(31, 31, 31)` |
| border | `0x262626` | `(38, 38, 38)` |
| border-strong | `0x3a3a3a` | `(58, 58, 58)` |
| text | `0xededed` | `(237, 237, 237)` |
| text-2 | `0xa1a1a1` | `(161, 161, 161)` |
| text-3 | `0x8a8a8a` | `(138, 138, 138)` |
| accent | `0x52a8ff` | `(82, 168, 255)` |
| accent-bg on surface (pre-composited) | `0x1a2632` | `(26, 38, 50)` |
| ok | `0x3fcf8e` | `(63, 207, 142)` |
| warn | `0xf5a524` | `(245, 165, 36)` |
| err | `0xff6166` | `(255, 97, 102)` |
| err-bg on bg (pre-composited) | `0x231313` | `(35, 19, 19)` |

In C++ use `ofColor::fromHex(0x52a8ff)`; in pygame use the tuple directly. Alpha tokens are pre-composited because neither surface blends translucent fills over arbitrary backgrounds by default.

**pygame sidebar limits and equivalents:**
- No CSS focus ring: when a control has keyboard focus, draw a 2px Signal Blue rect around it with a 2px gap (`pygame.draw.rect(..., width=2, border_radius=8)`).
- Radius via `border_radius=` on `pygame.draw.rect` (8 panels, 6 controls, 4 parts). Hairlines are 1px `width=1` rects in `border` / `border-strong`.
- No letter-spacing, no `font-feature-settings`: Geist Mono already gives fixed-width figures, so render all numbers in Mono. Wordmark and title tracking are dropped.
- No hover on touch and no CSS transitions: switch knob position snaps; that matches the reduced-motion behavior and is acceptable.
- No box-shadow: popover-like overlays rely on `surface-2` plus `border-strong` only.
- Keep 52px rows and 44px hit rects even though the sidebar is mouse-driven.

**ofxDatGui panel limits and equivalents:**
- Map tokens through a custom `ofxDatGuiTheme` subclass (e.g. gui background to `bg`, component background to `surface`, input areas to `bg`, label text to `text`, slider fill and toggle-on to `accent`, mouse-over to `surface-2`, mouse-down to `surface-3`). Hide the colored left stripe or set it to `border`; it would otherwise break the One Signal Rule.
- One font file and one size per theme: use Geist Regular at the 14px-equivalent size; Mono and weight contrast aren't available per component.
- Components are square-cornered rectangles and toggles are checkboxes, not switches; accept both rather than faking radius with images.
- No keyboard focus ring and limited hover states; don't rely on hover to reveal anything.
- Keep component height at or above 44px where the panel is used on a touchscreen.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** let the live sand view lead the first viewport; controls sit beside it, grouped by job.
- **Do** step neutrals for depth: `bg` page, `surface` panel, `surface-2` raised, `surface-3` pressed, and recess wells back to `bg`.
- **Do** use Signal Blue only for on, selected and focus (`:focus-visible` is a 2px `accent` outline, 2px offset).
- **Do** pair every status color with text, and write error copy that names the fix.
- **Do** set every system number, PIN, URL and key in Geist Mono with tabular figures.
- **Do** keep hit areas at 44px and control rows at 52px on every surface, native panels included.
- **Do** use the single ease-out curve `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` at 150ms for color/border changes, 200 to 220ms for movement, and drop movement under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Do** keep Geist and Geist Mono vendored locally; the dashboard must work offline.

### Don't:
- **Don't** build an admin-template stat-card grid; facts live in one hairline strip under the view.
- **Don't** add glow, colored shadows, gradients on chrome, or backdrop-filter glass.
- **Don't** introduce a second accent or use status hues decoratively.
- **Don't** hand-pick theme swatch colors; they come from the sandbox's real palettes.
- **Don't** show a control the connected app can't honor; hide it or disable its group with an explanation.
- **Don't** rely on hover to reveal anything essential; key-cap hints are the only hover reveal and they vanish on touch.
- **Don't** theme the operator UI with sand, terrain or novelty motifs; the projection owns that.
- **Don't** swap Geist for another face to satisfy an overused-font warning; it was chosen deliberately.
